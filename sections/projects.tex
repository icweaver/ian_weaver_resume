\subsection[A]{JuliaAstro \href{https://juliaastro.github.io/dev/index.html}{[link]} \hfill 2020 -- Present}
\subtext{Contributor and member of the Julia astronomy organization}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Designed the Keplerian orbit capabilities for the transit modeling package, Transits.jl \href{https://juliaastro.github.io/Transits.jl/dev/}{[link]}, which uses automatic unit and integration testing via GitHub Actions, supports Python interoperability, and produces competitive benchmark performance.
\item Implemented several dust extinction models for the interstellar medium observations package DustExtinction.jl \href{https://juliaastro.github.io/DustExtinction.jl/stable/}{[link]}, which provides first-class support for measurements containing units and estimated uncertainties.
\end{zitemize}

% PROJECT B
%====================
\subsection[B]{Team member, Graduate course final project \href{https://github.com/icweaver/pyhat}{[link]} \hfill Fall 2019}
\subtext{Python implementation for new algorithm estimating MCMC uncertainty}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Addressed limitations in current definition of the $\hat R$ statistic by implementing a new algorithm proposed by Veharti et al. (2019).
\item Packaged this deliverable as a set of Jupyter notebooks, including comprehensive documentation, example usage, and sample figures with associated npy and pickle data sets.
\end{zitemize}

\subsection[C]{Team member, Graduate course final project \href{https://spacejam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}{[link]} \hfill Fall 2018}
\subtext{Python package for differential equation solving, powered by automatic differentiation}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Designed and developed a numerical integration Python package, and demonstrated its usage in fields ranging from Astronomy to Ecology.
\item Deployed extensive documentation via ReadTheDocs.io, unit testing with pytest, and bounded registration on PyPI for the duration of the course.
\end{zitemize}
